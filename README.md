## blockat: a block-based web interpreter for learning Python

The blockat website is designed to allow students to easily learn Python. The website allows students to program with a custom block-based language, which is transpiled to Python. There are a few existing solutions for this, but none offer a comprehensive learning suite that provides the full power of the Python language to students in a block-based form. The block language introduced also has the extensibility to be integrated with different Python modules and packages, leveraging the massive community of open-source Python software. Most importantly, all of the code for this project is open-source, allowing students and educators to look inside the hood and gain complete control over their learning.
